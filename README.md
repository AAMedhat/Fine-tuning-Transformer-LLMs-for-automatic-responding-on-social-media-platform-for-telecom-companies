# Fine-tuning-Transformer-LLMs-for-automatic-responding-on-social-media-platform-for-telecom-companies

This repository showcases the development of an intelligent bot tailored for telecom companies to handle customer interactions on social media platforms. The bot utilizes advanced NLP techniques and fine-tuned transformer models/LLMs to generate automated responses.


## Overview

### The project includes:

* Jupyter notebooks for fine-tuning transformer models (AraT5v2 and LLAMA3).

* CSV file containing the dataset used for training and evaluation.


## Prerequisites

# Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* Python 3.8 or later

* Jupyter Notebook


## Files in the Repository

* fineTuningArat5ForAutoReply.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning the AraT5v2 model.

* fineTuningLlama3ForAutoReply-last.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for fine-tuning the LLAMA3 model.

* datanewWithoutNoRealplays.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and evaluation.


## Fine-tuning Transformer Models

### The project utilizes transformer models for text generation and question answering:

* AraT5v2: Fine-tuned for generating responses in Arabic.

* LLAMA3: Fine-tuned for generating responses in Arabic.
